Discovery is a powerful PowerShell module that lets you probe the inner depths of the operating system.

You can search .NET types with reflection using Get-Type, find every COM object on the system with Get-ProgID, search the WMI repository for useful tidbits with Search-Wmi, and find commands that can handle specific types of data with Find-CommandWithParameterType.
